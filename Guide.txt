		-- General --

This version of WebClash is work-in-progress,
and thus may contain bugs and glitches.

An account with administrator privileges should 
already exist:

user: admin
pass: password


		 -- Maps --

WebClash makes use of maps created in 
Tiled (www.mapeditor.org), these maps can be
imported using the Maps interface.

Colliders are supported, however only in
the rectangular form.
Colliders can be created using object layers
or tile specific colliders.

The custom properties available for Tiled 
tileset objects are as follows:

[Design]

* "NPC"		-> Spawns a NPC with the specified 
		   name (string value)

[Events]

* "loadMap" 	-> Loads the map with the specified 
		   name (string value)
* "positionX"   -> Set player position tile X
                   (int value)
* "positionY"   -> Set player position tile Y
		   (int value)
