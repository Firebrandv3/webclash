		-- General --

This version of WebClash is work-in-progress,
and may thus contain bugs and glitches.


		 -- Maps --

WebClash makes use of maps created in 
Tiled (www.mapeditor.org), these maps can be
imported using the Maps interface.

Colliders are supported, however only in
the rectangular form.

The custom properties available for Tiled 
tileset objects are as follows:

[Events]

* "loadMap" 	-> Loads a map with the 
		   specified ID (int value)
* "positionX"   -> Set player position tile X
                   (int value)
* "positionY"   -> Set player position tile Y
		   (int value)


	        -- Commands --

WebClash allows chat commands when the said
player has admin priviliges.
Admin priviliges can be granted in the permissions
file, located in the server folder.

To see the list of available commands type
/help in the chat.
